// Sure, here's a math problem based on your description:

// Suppose you have a room with height H pixels, where the top of the room is at y = 0 and the bottom of the room is at y = H - 1. You also have a player located at position (x, y) in the room, where x is the horizontal coordinate and y is the vertical coordinate. Finally, you have a function f(y) that determines the horizontal position of the player sprite based on its vertical position in the room, according to the following rules:

// If y = 0, then f(y) = x (i.e., the player sprite is drawn at its actual horizontal position).
// If y = H - 1, then f(y) = x (i.e., the player sprite is drawn at its actual horizontal position).
// For any other value of y, f(y) is calculated as follows: Let d be the distance from y to the nearest edge of the room (i.e., either the top or bottom edge). Then f(y) is defined as follows:
// If d = 0, then f(y) = x (i.e., the player sprite is drawn at its actual horizontal position).
// If d > 0, then f(y) is calculated using an exponential scaling factor k as follows:
// scss

f(y) = x + (f(0) - x) * exp(-k * d)
// where f(0) is the horizontal position of the player sprite when y = 0. The value of k determines how rapidly the horizontal position of the player sprite changes as y moves away from the nearest edge of the room.
// Your task is to calculate the value of f(y) for a given player position (x, y) and exponential scaling factor k.

// Set the player's position
var x = ...; // Replace with the player's actual x coordinate
var y = ...; // Replace with the player's actual y coordinate

// Set the room height
var H = room_height;

// Set the exponential scaling factor
var k = 0.01; // Replace with your desired value of k

// Calculate the distance to the nearest edge of the room
var d = min(y, H - y - 1);

// Calculate the horizontal position of the player sprite
var f0 = x;
var fy = x;
if (d > 0)
{
    var factor = exp(-k * d);
    fy = x + (f0 - x) * factor;
}

// Draw the player sprite
draw_sprite(sprite_index, 0, fy, y);


// Explanation:

// This script uses the given player position (x, y), room height H, and exponential scaling factor k to calculate the horizontal position of the player sprite at the given vertical position y. The distance to the nearest edge of the room is calculated as d = min(y, H - y - 1), and then the horizontal position of the player sprite is calculated using an exponential scaling factor factor = exp(-k * d) and the formula f(y) = x + (f(0) - x) * factor, where f(0) is the horizontal position of the player sprite at the top of the room (y = 0).

// The calculated horizontal position fy is then used to draw the player sprite using the draw_sprite() function, with the sprite index and subimage set to sprite_index and 0, respectively.

// Set the player's position
var x = ...; // Replace with the player's actual x coordinate
var y = ...; // Replace with the player's actual y coordinate

// Set the room height
var H = room_height;

// Set the exponential scaling factor
var k = 0.01; // Replace with your desired value of k

// Calculate the distance to the nearest edge of the room
var d = min(y, H - y - 1);

// Calculate the vertical position of the player sprite
var f0 = H / 2;
var fy = H / 2;
if (d > 0)
{
    var factor = exp(-k * d);
    fy = H / 2 + (y - H / 2) * factor;
}

// Draw the player sprite
draw_sprite(sprite_index, 0, x, fy);



// Explanation:

// This script is similar to the previous one, but it calculates the vertical position of the player sprite instead of the horizontal position. The distance to the nearest edge of the room is calculated as d = min(y, H - y - 1), and then the vertical position of the player sprite is calculated using an exponential scaling factor factor = exp(-k * d) and the formula f(y) = H/2 + (y - H/2) * factor, where H/2 is the midpoint of the room.

// The calculated vertical position fy is then used to draw the player sprite using the draw_sprite() function, with the sprite index and subimage set to sprite_index and 0, respectively. The x coordinate is left unchanged, since the horizontal positioning is not affected by the exponential scaling.
