> In probability theory and statistics, the **variance-to-mean ratio (VMR)**,
> like the coefficient of variation, is a normalized measure of the dispersion
> of a probability distribution: it is a measure used to quantify whether
> a set of observed occurrences are clustered or dispersed compared to a
> standard statistical model.

> It is defined as the ratio of the variance \(\sigma^2\) to the mean \(\mu\),

> \( \large D = {\sigma^2 \over \mu } \).
