> In probability theory and statistics, **variance** measures how far a

> the values are identical. Variance is always non-negative: a small
> variance indicates that the data points tend to be very close to
> the mean (expected value) and hence to each other, while a high
> variance indicates that the data points are very spread out around
> the mean and from each other.
