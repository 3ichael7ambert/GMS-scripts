ds_grid_draw
============

![right](/images/ds_grid_draw.png "ds_grid_draw()")

This script will draw the contents of a grid data structure which is
populated by numerical data. It performs a normalization process so 
that the entire range of values within the grid are drawn from black
to white.

While the script is very simple and lacks options, it can be especially 
useful for development and debugging purposes.
