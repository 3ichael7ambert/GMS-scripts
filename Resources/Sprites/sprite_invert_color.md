sprite_invert_color
===================

![right](/images/sprite_invert_color.gif "sprite_invert_color()")

This script will permanently change the colors of a sprite resource to 
inverted colors, eg. black to white, yellow to blue, etc. It is a can be 
a slow process, especially for large sprites or sprites with many frames.

For scripts which can draw sprites inverted in real-time, see 
[draw_sprite_inverted()] and [draw_sprite_inverted_ext()].
