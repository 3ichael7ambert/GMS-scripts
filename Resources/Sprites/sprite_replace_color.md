sprite_replace_color
====================

Replaces one color in a given sprite with another. It is meant to called once 
per color replacement. This only needs be done once, such as at the start of
a game.

![sprite_replace_color()](/images/sprite_replace_color.gif "sprite_replace_color()")

Note: Here is a much slower script that supports color blending:
[sprite_replace_color_blend()](/script/sprite_replace_color_blend)

script: sprite_replace_color.gml
